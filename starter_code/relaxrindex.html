	From Joni: Overall comments

	Hi Julie!  I am going to put my comments for your code in comments like this one.

	Make sure you stay consistant with your indenting.  Any time you open a new tag, indent in.  
	Any time you close a tag, indent out.  So, for example:

	<section>
		<h1>This is my heading</h1>
		<div>
			<p>Some text here</p>
			<p>Some text here too</p>
		</div>
	</section>
-->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
    	
<title>Relaxr</title>

		<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reset.css">
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/stylerelaxr.css">
		<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>

	</head>

	<!-- 
		This line below can be deleted - you already have it inside your <head>.  Also, make sure that all
		tags are inside either your <head> or your <body>
